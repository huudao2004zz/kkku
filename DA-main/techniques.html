         <h1>Techniques of Mountaineering</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
         <p>
            Aside from the division of mountaineering into individual disciplines according to their various aspects, as
            mentioned in the previous section, we should also mention the differences in the concept behind climbing
            techniques. When we choose specific climbing techniques for a climb, we thereby significantly define the
            character of the climb. Certain techniques of climbing are so specific that their use can be described as a
            separate mountaineering discipline.
         </p>
         <p>
            By climbing technique we mean a particular method of acting which the mountaineer uses to move about in the
            terrain. While the climber progresses directly along the rope (single rope technique) with rope techniques
            used in speleoalpinism, work at heights or rescue work, in mountaineering or rock climbing the mountaineer
            moves along climbing terrain during the ascent.
         </p>
         <p>
            At the same time the mountaineer has a choice of two climbing techniques: either free climbing or technical
            climbing. With free climbing the climber overcomes gravity using only her own strength and progresses uses
            only natural rock formations. At the same time certain methods of protection techniques, meaning accessories
            and gear, are used simply to protect her from a fall.
            <br>
            In comparison to this, during technical climbing artificial resources are used for progress, intermediate
            points protection (pitons, nuts, etc.) are grasped with the hands and runners and other stirrups are hung
            from intermediate points of protection placed in the rock and stepped in. Indeed technical climbing is so
            specific that it is often perceived as an entirely independent mountaineering discipline.
         </p>
         <p>
            The participation of the individuals is closely associated with the techniques of climbing. We ca climb with
            others in a team, or by ourselves. It is simpler to climb as part of a team, as the climbers can share a
            series of activities, and thereby ease their progress. Of course it is also possible to climb alone, and
            such a method of ascent is called solo climbing, during which a solo ascent is performed. And again there
            are two possibilities how to perform a solo ascent - either to self-belay, or to climb without belay.
