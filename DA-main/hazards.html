         <h1>Hazards of Mountaineering</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
         <p>Mountaineers face a variety of hazards. When climbing mountains, there are two types of hazards,
            objective and subjective. Objective hazards relate to the environment, and may include inclement weather
            conditions, dangerous terrain, and poor equipment. Subjective hazards relate to a climber's poor
            judgement, poor planning, lack of skills, or inadequate conditioning. In terms of objective hazards, the
            dangers mountaineers face include falling rocks, falling ice, snow-avalanches, the climber falling, falls
            from ice slopes, falls down snow slopes, falls into crevasses, and the dangers from altitude and weather
            Mountain Climbing Risks: 20 Hazards to Be Aware Of Written by Marcus in Uncategorized Mountain climbing
            is an inherently dangerous activity, and you need to be aware of the dangers before you go out. So, what
            are the main risks in mountain climbing? Falling, avalanche danger, exposure to the elements, and
            altitude sickness are among the most prevalent risks that you'll face while mountaineering, although
            that's far from a comprehensive list. There's a whole host of mountain climbing risks that you'll have to
            face if you decide to take up this sport. Some of them (like falling and exhaustion) you'll have to
            content with every time you go mountain climbing, while others (like altitude sickness) will only become
            relevant once you start pushing the boundaries on some of the hardest mountains in the world. Now, this
            article isn't meant to dissuade you from mountain climbing (I do it all the time, and I love it), but
            rather to make you aware of the dangers so that you can plan for them!</p>
         <div class="des">
            <h2>Falling and Avalanches</h2>
            <p>Maybe the most common danger, and one that almost everyone is afraid of. Avalanches can hit you at any
               time, and even the best mountaineers in the world sometimes succumb to
               them.</p>
            <h2>Weather and Exposure</h2>
            <div class="grid">
               <p>Weather patterns in the mountains change quickly, and you can find yourself stuck if the conditions
                  suddenly turn.Spending tens of hours in the beating sun or freezing cold can start to mess with your
                  body and brain (I recently dropped a rappel device due to heat stroke).</p>

                  allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <h2>Hypothermia</h2>
            <p>Spending too long in the cold will cause your body to start to shut down. Not getting enough oxygen to
               your brain can muddle your thinking and cause fever-like symptoms</p>
            <h2>Altitude sickness</h2>
            <div class="grid">
               <iframe width="450px" height="250px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EGeMffmDv4"
                  title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"

                  allowfullscreen></iframe>
               <p>Rapid ascent can lead to altitude sickness. The best treatment is to descend immediately. The
                  climber's motto at high altitude is "climb high, sleep low", referring to the regimen of climbing
                  higher to acclimatise but returning to lower elevation to sleep. In the Andes, the chewing of coca
                  leaves has been traditionally used to treat altitude sickness symptoms. Common symptoms of altitude
                  sickness include severe headache, sleep problems, nausea, lack of appetite, lethargy and body ache.
                  Mountain sickness may progress to HACE (High altitude cerebral edema) and HAPE (High altitude
                  pulmonary edema), both of which can be fatal within 24 hours. In high mountains, atmospheric pressure
                  is lower and this means that less oxygen is available to breathe.[35] This is the underlying cause of
                  altitude sickness. Everyone needs to acclimatise, even exceptional mountaineers that have been to high
                  altitude before. Generally speaking, mountaineers start using bottled oxygen when they climb above
                  7,000 m. Exceptional mountaineers have climbed 8000-metre peaks (including Everest) without oxygen,
                  almost always with a carefully planned program of acclimatisation.</p>

            <h2>Extreme Temperatures</h2>
            <p>When climbing in a hot environment, you risk getting heat injuries. This includes heat exhaustion and
               heat stroke. When climbing in a cold environment, you could lose your body heat too quickly. This
               leads to frostbites and hypothermia. Heat exhaustion: This is due to your body overheating. Symptoms
               include heavy sweating, dizziness, fainting, quick and weak heartbeat, headache, nausea, fatigue. What
               to do: Rest in the shade, drink cold water or sports drink. Seek medical attention if the condition
               does not improve. Heat stroke: When heat exhaustion is not treated, you could get heat stroke.
               Symptoms include fever (temperature going above 104 F (40 C)), dry skin, dizziness, pounding
               heartbeat, headache, nausea, fatigue, confusion, loss of consciousness. What to do: Rest in the shade,
               drink cold water or sports drink. Remove all excess clothing, use water/ sponges/ ice packs/ wet
               towels to cool the body. Seek medical attention immediately. Hypothermia: This is due to the loss of
               body heat. Symptoms include temperatures going below 95 F (35 C), shivering, slow and shallow
               breathing, weak heartbeat, fatigue, confusion, loss of consciousness. What to do: Move to a dry and
               warm location, remove any wet or cold clothing, cover with warm and dry clothing and blankets. Drink
               hot or warm drinks. Seek medical attention. Frostbite: Extreme loss of body heat which causes freezing
               of the skin and underlying tissues. This usually occurs at your extremities such as hands and feet
               Symptoms include cold skin, prickly feeling, numbness, the stiffness of joints and muscles, skin
               turning red, white or blueish. What to do: Move to a dry and warm location, remove any wet or cold
               clothing, cover with warm and dry clothing and blankets. Stop walking if your feet are frostbitten,
               You can use heating packs to warm your hands and feet. But do this slowly to avoid burns. Drink hot or
               warm drinks. Seek medical attention immediately. How to avoid getting too hot: Protect yourself from
               the sun with caps and long sleeve shirts and pants. Take frequent breaks in the shade. Hydrate
               regularly. Don't avoid drinking water because you want to avoid having to pee. Avoid wearing too many
               layers of clothing. You will dehydrate more quickly from sweating. If you are feeling unwell, inform
               someone and stop climbing. How to avoid getting too cold: Pack appropriate climbing attire. Bring
               along a few thinner layers instead of one thick jacket. Pack portable heat source such as heat packs.
               Make sure to stay dry. Have proper wet weather protection such as waterproof jackets or ponchos. Avoid
               walking through water bodies such as rivers and streams. Avoid wearing too many layers of clothing.
               The evaporation of sweat will cause you to lose body heat.</p>

            <h2>Wildlife</h2>
            <p>You are disturbing the wildlife's habitat in an area where human activity is low. If you did not store
               your food or dispose of your waste properly, they can attract wildlife. You are wearing strongly
               scented products. Some strong odors might attract wildlife. What happens when you encounter wildlife:
               You might get attacked by provoked or scared animals. You might get bitten or stung by poisonous
               snakes, spiders, and other insects. Wildlife might take your food or damage your stuff. How to avoid
               encountering wildlife: Make loud noises (in a considerate manner, not by blasting loud music). A bear
               bell is a common accessory for people climbing in areas with a bear population. Walking loudly will
               also keep a lot of animals and snakes away. Store your food properly. Use ziplocks or airtight
               containers to keep the smell in. Store your trash properly. Leaving food waste around is like leaving
               breadcrumbs for the animals. Use bug sprays. Avoid wearing bright, floral colored clothing which may
               attract bees and wasps. What to do if you encounter wildlife: Don't approach them. Don't scare them.
               Back away slowly and quietly. Don't feed any wildlife. Not even the friendly, harmless looking ones
               like deer or squirrels. Once they are used to being fed by humans, they will start approaching all
               human for food. And they won't take no for an answer! If you think you are in danger, flee where
               possible, preferably to higher grounds. If you don't think you can outrun them, you should make loud
               noises. You can also make yourself appear bigger by standing tall and grabbing large sticks or rocks.
               Hire a guide. New climbers should always hire a guide. Even experienced climbers should hire a guide
               when going on more challenging climbs.
