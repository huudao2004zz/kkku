         <h1>History of Mountaineering</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
         <h2>Early mountaineering</h2>
         <div class="grid">
            <p>Humans have been present in mountains since prehistory. The remains of Otzi, who lived in the 4th
               millennium
               BC, were found in a glacier in the Ötztal Alps. However, the highest mountains were rarely visited early
               on, and were often associated with supernatural or religious concepts. Nonetheless, there are many
               documented examples of people climbing mountains prior to the formal development of the sport in the 19th
               century, although many of these stories are sometimes considered fictional or legendary.
               <br>
               The famous poet Petrarch describes his 26 April 1336 ascent of Mount Ventoux (1,912 m (6,273 ft)) in one
               of
               his epistolae familiares, claiming to be inspired by Philip V of Macedon's ascent of Mount Haemo.

            </p>

            </div>
         </div>
         <p>

            For most of antiquity, climbing mountains was a practical or symbolic activity, usually undertaken for
            economic, political, or religious purposes. A commonly cited example is the 1492 ascent of Mont Aiguille
            (2,085 m (6,841 ft)) by Antoine de Ville, a French military officer and lord of Domjulien and Beaupré.
            <br>
            In the Andes, around the late 1400s and early 1500s many ascents were made of extremely high peaks by the
            Incas and their subjects. The highest they are known for certain to have climbed is 6739 m at the summit of
            Volcan Llullaillaco
         </p>
         <h2>The Enlightenment and the Golden Age of Alpinism</h2>
         <div class="grid">
            
            <img src="images/history-2.png" alt="">
            <p>The Age of Enlightenment and the Romantic era marked a change of attitudes towards high mountains. In 1757
               Swiss scientist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure made the first of several unsuccessful attempts on Mont Blanc in
               France. He then offered a reward to anyone who could climb the mountain, which was claimed in 1786 by
               Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard. The climb is usually considered an epochal event in the history
               of mountaineering, a symbolic mark of the birth of the sport.
               <br>
               By the early 19th century, many of the alpine peaks were reached, including the Grossglockner in 1800, the
               Ortler in 1804, the Jungfrau in 1811, the Finsteraarhorn in 1812, and the Breithorn in 1813.[14] In 1808,
               Marie Paradis became the first woman to climb Mont Blanc, followed in 1838 by Henriette d'Angeville.
            </p>
         </div>
         <p>
            The beginning of mountaineering as a sport in the UK is generally dated to the ascent of the Wetterhorn in
            1854 by English mountaineer Sir Alfred Wills, who made mountaineering fashionable in Britain. This
            inaugurated what became known as the Golden Age of Alpinism, with the first mountaineering club - the Alpine
            Club - being founded in 1857.
            <br>
            One of the most dramatic events was the spectacular first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 by a party led by
            English illustrator Edward Whymper, in which four of the party members fell to their deaths. By this point
            the sport of mountaineering had largely reached its modern form, with a large body of professional guides,
            equipment, and methodologies.
            <br>
            Edelweiss, a plant associated with mountain sports
            In the early years of the "golden age", scientific pursuits were intermixed with the sport, such as by the
            physicist John Tyndall. In the later years, it shifted to a more competitive orientation as pure sportsmen
            came to dominate the London-based Alpine Club and alpine mountaineering overall. The first president of
            the Alpine Club, John Ball, is considered to be the discoverer of the Dolomites, which for decades were the
            focus of climbers like Paul Grohmann and Angelo Dibona. At that time, the edelweiss also established
            itself as a symbol of alpinists and mountaineers.
         </p>
         <h2>Expansion around the world</h2>
         <div class="grid">
            <p>In the 19th century, the focus of mountaineering turned towards mountains beyond the Alps, and by the turn
               of the 20th century, mountaineering had acquired a more international flavour.
               <br>
               In 1897 Mount Saint Elias (18,008 ft (5,489 m)) on the Alaska-Yukon border was summitted by the Duke of the
               Abruzzi and party. In 1879-1880 the exploration of the highest Andes in South America began when English
               mountaineer Edward Whymper climbed Chimborazo (20,549 ft (6,263 m)) and explored the mountains of
               Ecuador. It took until the late 19th century for European explorers to penetrate Africa. Mount
               Kilimanjaro in Africa was climbed in 1889 by Austrian mountaineer Ludwig Purtscheller and German geologist
               Hans Meyer, Mount Kenya in 1899 by Halford Mackinder.

         </div>
         <h2>The last frontier: The Himalayas</h2>
         <p>
            The last[clarification needed] and greatest mountain range was the Himalayas in South Asia. They had
            initially been surveyed by the British Empire for military and strategic reasons. In 1892 Sir William Martin
            Conway explored the Karakoram Himalayas, and climbed a peak of 23,000 ft (7,000 m). In 1895 Albert F.
            Mummery died while attempting Nanga Parbat, while in 1899 Douglas Freshfield took an expedition to the snowy
            regions of Sikkim.
            <br>
            In 1899, 1903, 1906, and 1908 American mountaineer Fanny Bullock Workman (one of the first professional
            female mountaineers) made ascents in the Himalayas, including one of the Nun Kun peaks (23,300 ft (7,100
            m)). A number of Gurkha sepoys were trained as expert mountaineers by Charles Granville Bruce, and a good
            deal of exploration was accomplished by them.
            <br>
            In 1902 the Eckenstein-Crowley Expedition, led by English mountaineer Oscar Eckenstein and English occultist
            Aleister Crowley was the first to attempt to scale K2. They reached 22,000 feet (6,700 m) before turning
            back due to weather and other mishaps. Undaunted, in 1905 Crowley led the first expedition to Kangchenjunga,
            the third highest mountain in the world, in an attempt described as "misguided" and "lamentable".
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYg-luBRl8g" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <br>
            Eckenstein was also a pioneer in developing new equipment and climbing methods. He started using shorter ice
            axes which could be used single-handed, designed the modern crampons and improved on the nail patterns used
            for the climbing boots.
            <br>
            By the 1950s, all the eight-thousanders but two had been climbed starting with Annapurna in 1950 by Maurice
            Herzog and Louis Lachenal on the 1950 French Annapurna expedition. The highest of these peaks Mount Everest
            was climbed in 1953 after the British had made several attempts in the 1920s; the 1922 expedition reached
            8,320 metres (27,300 ft) before being aborted on the third summit attempt after an avalanche killed seven
            porters. The 1924 expedition saw another height record achieved but still failed to reach the summit with
            confirmation when George Mallory and Andrew Irvine disappeared on the final attempt. The summit was finally
            reached on 29 May 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay from the south side in Nepal.
            <br>
            Just a few months later, Hermann Buhl made the first ascent of Nanga Parbat (8,125 m), on the 1953
            German-Austrian Nanga Parbat expedition, a siege-style[clarify] expedition culminating in a last 1,300
            meters walking alone, being under the influence of drugs: pervitin (based on the stimulant methamphetamine
            used by soldiers during World War II), padutin and tea from coca leaves. K2 (8,611 m), the second-highest
            peak in the world, was first scaled in 1954 by Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni. In 1964, the final
            eight-thousander to be climbed was Shishapangma (8,013 m), the lowest of all the 8,000-metre peaks.
            Reinhold Messner from the Dolomites mountain range (Italy) was then the first to climb all eight-thousanders
            up to 1986, in addition to be the first without supplemental oxygen. In 1978 he climbed Mount Everest with
            Peter Habeler without supplemental oxygen, the first men to do so.

         <h2>Today</h2>
         <p>
            Long the domain of the wealthy elite and their agents, the emergence of the middle-class in the 19th and
            20th centuries resulted in mass interest in mountaineering. It became a popular pastime and hobby of many
            people. Some have come to criticize the sport as becoming too much of a tourist activity.
