            <h1>Mountaineering Guidelines</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Whether looking to climb mountains in this country or overseas, your body is sure to face some key
                fitness battles so you need to be properly prepared for what you might face, including potential
                emergencies.Training for mountaineering: Mountaineering is a pursuit that should never be undertaken
                without a good understanding of the many different aspects involved, ranging from map reading and
                navigation skills to rope work and understanding mountain weather. You should definitely consider
                booking up with a reputable organisation offering expert advice.</p>

            <h2>Preparation and planning:</h2>
            <p>
                Take time to plan and prepare for your ascent. This will be time well spent and the chances of your
                having a successful and enjoyable ascent will be far higher if you have prepared well. Take time to plan
                your route and prepare your kit regardless of whether you’re going for a short climb or a two month
                expedition, some careful planning can make all the difference. As well as careful planning, always check
                your kit before you leave … it is no good being out on the mountain only to find you left your ice-ax at
                home.
            </p>
            <h2>Footwear for mountaineering:</h2>
            <p>
                Make sure you invest in a good pair of rugged mountaineering boots. For summer mountaineering you can
                get away with a stiff pair of walking boots, but for winter mountaineering a crampon rated boot will be
                needed. Visit a reputable outdoor retailer who will offer good advice on the best mountaineering boot to
                suit your needs.
            </p>
            <h2>Food for mountaineering:</h2>
            <p>
                Make sure to carry plenty of food (and water) on any mountaineering trip. Food needs to be high in
                energy and lightweight. Many high-energy bars and pre-packaged meals are now available. Food can make or
                break longer expeditions so make sure the food you carry is something tasty and enjoyable too! It is
                essential on any mountaineering trip to carry emergency rations in case you are on the mountain for
                longer than anticipated.
            </p>
            <h2>Weather watching:</h2>
            <p>
                Before embarking on any mountaineering trip make sure you get a local weather forecast. You can always
                postpone a summit attempt for another day, with more favourable weather conditions. However, once you
                are on a mountaineering route you will often be committed with little options for retreat so checking
                the weather in advance is a must!
            </p>
            <h2>Emergency shelter:</h2>
            <p>
                Too many completely avoidable accidents and injuries occur in mountaineering because people simply
                underestimate the awesome forces of mountain weather. Always carry an emergency shelter, they are small
                and lightweight but can be life savers, protecting you from the elements should the weather suddenly
                turn. There are many shelters available from two-person to large group shelters. Some of the best
                available are Terra Novas Bothy Bags.
            </p>
            <h1>development In Mountaineering</h1>
            <h2>Funding, training urged for promotion of mountaineering:</h2>
            <p>Islamabad : Speaking at a webinar on ‘mountaineering challenges confronting Pakistan,’ the experts urged
                the government to urgently establish a professional mountaineering school and a strong Alpine Club of
                Pakistan (ACP) having right professionals on board. The experts also appreciated the Pakistan army for
                conducting the rescue operations quite efficiently when needed. They highlighted that getting a
                mountaineering permit takes too long despite the Prime Minister’s instruction to reduce the processing
                time. It takes too much time to get a visa for the foreign tourists though the federal government has
                announced a lenient visa policy. The webinar was organised by the Development Communications Network
                (Devcom-Pakistan) on Saturday. The panel of experts included well-known mountaineer Nazir Sabir, another
                well-known mountaineer Col (r) Abdul Jabbar Bhatti, founder and chairman Baltistan Association of Tour
                Operators (BATO) Muhammad Iqbal, Secretary Alpine Club of Pakistan Karrar Haideri, mountaineering
                trainer Dr. Shabbir Naqvi, president Adventure Club Tahir Imran Khan, Pakistan Mountain Festival founder
                and director and Devcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed, event manager Samreen Akhtar, and
                Ozyegin University student of Hospitality and Tourism Management Shaaref Munir. Nazir Sabir said all
                stakeholders need to sit together to develop an integrated policy for mountaineering and trekking.
                Mountaineering should be a national phenomenon like cricket. But unfortunately we lack state patronage
                and recognition and so is the case of corporate sponsorships. In fact, the Alpine Club Pakistan has no
                capacity to handle the national framework of mountaineering and it needs to be reformed. Col (r) Abdul
                Jabbar Bhatti said mountaineering is an adventure sport that is based on your own resources, skills and
                risk. Mountaineers and High Altitude Porters (HAPs) have no insurance schemes in Pakistan, no proper
                training and no sponsorships. Corporate sector will not come up to support this sport until it is not
                adequately mainstreamed. We have no structured system for mountaineering and trekking. We need to put
                ‘right persons on the right jobs’ if interested to do the needful, and it will not happen sooner even if
                we start today. Devcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed said rights professionals and a vigorous
                framework is very essential for mainstreaming of mountaineering. Government and the state institutions
                need to have some liberal and lenient policies to attract foreign mountaineers and trekkers. We shall
                also have an adequate monitoring and checking system to reduce high altitude pollution. Secretary ACP
                Karrar Haideri said the Alpine Club received a lot of criticism but not funding at least for the last
                three years even though we are trying to survive. All officer bearers perform their duties without any
                remunerations. We have taken up issues with the government several times but are still waiting for the
                patronage and support. The Pakistan army has had a meeting of stakeholders recently to develop an
                outline of the framework to promote mountaineering in Pakistan. The National Tourism Coordination Board
                (NTCB) is also focusing on it. Dr. Shabbir Naqvi said we lack funding and training for mountaineering in
                general because the ACP could not deliver the desired outcome as envisaged in their mandate. We have yet
                to organize and recognize mountaineering as a sport. Nepal offers Bachelor and Masters level education
                in mountaineering while we have no professional training school. Tahir Imran Khan said we need to have
                professionalism to attract commercialism along with a thorough professional attitude of the relevant
                organizations. Marketing of the mountains is very important that is not possible without collaboration
                of all stakeholders.</p>
            <h2>Tak It Hame:</h2>
            <p>Tak It Hame is a Mountaineering Scotland campaign that says what it means: encouraging the mountaineering
                community, and others, to remove litter and plastic from our hills and crags. Tak It Hame aims to make a
                difference. We encourage everyone taking to the hills and climbing the crags to do a little on every
                trip, individually, or as part of a group or club outing. And to show others too: tell the world that we
                can all do something. Many of us already do, but the litter still accumulates. We need more people to do
                the same. The message is: can you bring back more than you took out?</p>
            <h2>Monitoring major development proposals: </h2>
            <p>We get approached every week by government agencies, local authorities, national parks and developers to
                comment on proposed wind farms designed to generate more than 50MW. Our decision to respond or object is
                guided by specific criteria, reflecting our vision, Respecting Scotland's Mountains. We only object to a
                very small proportion, but if permitted, they could have a huge impact on the wildness of some cherished
                locations.</p>
