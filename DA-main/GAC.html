            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The German Alpine Club was founded as Bildungsbürgerlicher Bergsteigerverein on 9 May 1869 in Munich by
                36 former members of the Austrian Alpine Club around the Ötztal curate Franz Senn,[citation needed] in
                order to promote the tourist development of the Eastern Alps by the erection of mountain huts, hiking
                trails, and via ferratas. The association enjoyed a large clientele from the beginning, with a number of
                1070 members after only 10 months. Mountain hut notice prohibiting the entry of Jews and Donauland
                members, c.1930 The German and the Austrian societies merged in 1873 to form the German and Austrian
                Alpine Club (DÖAV). Already in the late 19th century, the association's policies were increasingly
                characterized by nationalism and antisemitism. In 1899 the Brandenburg section amended an "Aryan
                paragraph" to exclude non-Christian members, followed by the Vienna section in 1905 and the Alpine
                corporations of Vienna and Munich in 1907 and 1910. After World War I, the Jewish associates like Viktor
                Frankl and Fred Zinnemann (adding up to about one third of the membership) were banned in most of the
                sections and in turn established a separate Donauland section insisting on their DÖAV fellowship. The
                Donauland members were officially ousted in 1924. Jews were even banned from visiting the DÖAV mountain
                huts.[2] Upon the 1938 Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany, the DÖAV was renamed Deutscher Alpenverein
                (DAV) under the leadership of Arthur Seyss-Inquart and incorporated as mountaineering division of the
                Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen (National Socialist League of the Reich for
                Physical Exercise) organization. After World War II, the DAV was dissolved by the Allied authorities.
                Its assets were held by the Austrian Alpine Club as trustee. The German Alpine Club was re-established
                in 1952. It joined the Deutscher Sportbund organization in 1992. After leaving the Union Internationale
                des Associations d'Alpinisme in 2008, mainly due to differences in respecting both competitions and
                recreational sports, the German and Austrian Alpine Clubs rejoined the Union Internationale des
                Associations d'Alpinisme in 2013.
