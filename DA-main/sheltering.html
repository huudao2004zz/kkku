         <h1>Shelters Used By Mountaineers</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
         <div class="des">
            <p>Mountain climbing is a strenuous and often dangerous activity. Because the weather conditions on
               mountains can change without notice, shelters can play a critical role in keeping climbers safe and
               protected. This article takes a look at the different types of shelters used by mountain climbers.</p>
            <h2>1. Base Camp</h2>
            <p>Base camps are most frequently used by mountain climbers who are trying to reach the summit of very high
               mountains. These shelters are often stocked with necessary supplies and provide climbers with a safe
               location for acclimatizing to extreme altitudes. When climbs to the summit take multiple days, several
               base camps may be located along the trails. Some of the most well-known base camps are located on Mount
               Everest.</p>
            <h2>2. Hut</h2>
            <p>Huts may be well-developed or rustic shelters, located in rural areas at differing elevations along a
               mountain. These shelters are designed around a shared dining area with private sleeping sleeping
               quarters. These sleeping rooms are stocked with a bed, pillows, and blankets. Climbers bring a sleeping
               bag. Like base camp, huts allow a trail to be divided into several days worth of hikes and make it
               possible for climbers to travel with a reduced pack. During warmer seasons, many huts have full-time
               staff or volunteers that manage the daily activities necessary to keep the shelter running. In some
               locations, climbers have the option to purchase snacks, meals, and drinks.</p>
            <h2>3. Tent</h2>
            <p>Tents consist of a pole framework, covered in a tarp or some other material and held by ropes and
               anchors. These shelters are set up at the moment it will be used and are easily portable. Simpler designs
               require just a thin tarp, while more durable designs incorporate heavier materials that can hold up
               against dangerous weather conditions. In extreme weather, tents may be set up behind mounds of snow or
               rock, which act as windbreaks and help protect the shelter. Tents are the most frequently used type of
               shelter.</p>
            <h2>4. Snow Cave</h2>
            <p>Snow caves are preferred over tents by some climbers, where weather conditions permit. These shelters are
               known to be warmer than tents and have only 2 requirements: snow and a snow shovel. Climbers can build a
               snow cave in a short amount of time, digging out an area under at least 4 feet of snow. The inner
               temperature is usually around 32Â° fahrenheit and for added warmth, climbers use waterproof, lightweight
               bivvy bags and foam sleeping pads. Another type of snow cave is an igloo, although this requires a very
               specific construction technique and should only be attempted by those with experience.</p>
            <h2>5. Bivouac</h2>
            <p>A bivouac, also known as a bivvy, is a very rudimentary type of shelter. It does not offer a completely
               enclosed shelter and in some cases, may involve simply sleeping in the open. When in the open, climbers
               use a sleeping bag and cover it with a bivouac sack (or bivvy bag). A bivouac sack is a lightweight,
               waterproof liner that provides an additional layer of protection against inclement weather and cold
               temperatures. Climbers may also set up a bivouac between a crack in nearby rocks or a ditch formed in the
               snow, both of these offer more shelter. This shelter is often chosen because it allows climbers to carry
               a reduced-weight pack. A bivouac does have the added risk of climbers being more exposed to dangerous
               weather.</p>
